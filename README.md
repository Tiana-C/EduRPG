## 🧩 How It Works

Everything runs inside interconnected Notion databases:

|-----------|----------|
| **Character** | Tracks HP, XP, gold, equipped items |
| **Scenes** | Contains narrative text, DC, and hidden outcomes |
| **Chapters** | Groups scenes, manages unlock logic |
| **Inventory** | Manages items and equipment bonuses |
| **Quest Log** | Awards XP when real-life tasks are completed |
| **Battle Log** | Records damage/healing events |

## 🧙‍♀️ Behind the Scenes

This system was designed by **Tiana Coats** as part of her cloud and network engineering studies after being inspired playing Diablo Immortal.  
This was built originally for **CompTIA Network+)**, later expanded into a general gamified study platform.

> *“I wanted to make studying feel like leveling up in an RPG to make learning fun and immersive.”*
